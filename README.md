# Snake
A snake game written in C by Oscar Bergstr√∂m, graphics were added thanks to https://www.raylib.com/.
This game has both a console and graphical version. So basically this repo is containing two games. 

Left to do: 
1. Add pause functionality to the console application. 
2. Bug fix: Direction of the snake is a bit bugged (console and raylib). sometimes the snake if the user is fast is able to traverse backwards, resulting in "game over".
3. Bug fix: In the console application score/food spawn, sometimes food is spawned out of view.
4. Enhancement: In the console application improve the movement of the snake. 
5. Refactor code. 
6. Testing. 
7. Finalize!
